# Register Students

## Project Description
This is a **Student Registration System** that allows users to register student ID numbers for an exam venue. The registered IDs are stored in a file (`reg_form.txt`), which serves as an attendance register for the exam.

### ðŸ’¡ Why is this important?
- Demonstrates the use of **file I/O operations** in Python.
- Uses a **for loop** to handle user input.
- Implements **exception handling** to ensure valid user input.

## **Usage**
1. The program will ask how many students are registering.
2. Enter the student ID numbers one by one.
3. The program will save the IDs in a file called reg_form.txt, formatted with dotted lines for signing.
