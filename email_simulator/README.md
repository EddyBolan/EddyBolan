# Email Simulator

## **Description**
This project is an **Email Simulator** built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.  
It allows users to manage emails by:
- Storing emails in an inbox.
- Listing emails with subject lines and indexes.
- Marking emails as read.
- Viewing unread emails.
- Selecting and reading emails.

This project demonstrates the importance of **data encapsulation, class methods, and user interaction** using Python.

## **Introduction**
In this task, we’re going to be creating an email simulator using OOP.
## **Installation**
To run this project, ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  

### **Steps to Install and Run Locally**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EddyBolan/codingTasks.git
   cd codingTasks
## **Usage**
Once the program starts, you will see a menu with the following options:
Read an email – Lists all emails, allowing the user to select and read one.
View unread emails – Displays only unread emails.
Quit application – Exits the program.

### **Example**
Would you like to:
1. Read an email
2. View unread emails
3. Quit application
Enter selection: 1
If the user chooses 1, the program displays a list of emails and prompts them to select an index.
## **Example Output**
Unread Emails List
All unread Emails:
Index    Subject
